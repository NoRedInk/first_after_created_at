# FirstAfterCreatedAt, a tool for using binary search to search by created_at.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NoRedInk/first_after_created_at.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NoRedInk/first_after_created_at)

Assuming you have an autoincrimenting primary keyÂ `id` and a id-sorted `created_at` column, you can use this gem to quickly search for items by time.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```Gemfile
gem 'first_after_created_at'
```

And then execute:
```shell
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
$ gem install first_after_created_at
```

## Usage

```ruby
ModelName.first_after_created_at(Time.parse('2017-01-01'))
=> #<ModelName:0x007f86fe7017c8 id: 1234, created_at: Sun, 01 Jan 2017 01:23:45 +0100
```
